## Preamble

It has been a while since I wrote anything meaningful aside from code, school project reports, technical documentation, or cover letters. I'm gonna be honest with you and say that there are some parts of this website that is generated by ChatGPT, but it's not in a _"I'm not creative enough to write and I'm too cheap to hire a ghost writer"_ kind of AI use, but more of _"I have some trouble expressing my thoughts coherently in writing and I'm too cheap to hire a proofreader"_. See? It's totally different and I am morally justified. That being said, I'm making a pinky promise to minimize Sam Altman's influence on my writings, because it is obvious that I need improve my composition skills, and I swear GPT-4o is making me dumber by the day. By creating this site and making myself known to the Internet, I hope that it gives me the motivation to continue practicing writing and to develop my own voice.

## About Me

My name is Siew Hui Zhuan, and I usually go by my given name Hui Zhuan (pronunciation: "h-wei zh-wan"). It is admittedly a challenge to pronounce, but you will get the hang of it after a few tries. People have called me "hooi" (that's not my name), "zhun" (nope), "zhan" (nope), "juan" (¡ay, caramba!), or "Siew" (that's my last name).

> In China, last name comes first.
>
> – Jian Yang, _Silicon Valley_

I can tolerate mispronuciations as long as you don't make fun of it, or else I will tell my dad.

You can find traces of me on some social media platforms. I won't accept follow requests unless I personally know you. However, you are welcome to introduce yourself in my DMs if you really want to be my friend (why?).

## Why?

Good question. Huh?
