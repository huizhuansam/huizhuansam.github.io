# Projects

Some software and adjacent projects I've done, along with the lessons I've learnt from them.

## [BetterPrep](https://github.com/huizhuansam/BetterPrep)

**Description:** BetterPrep is an application that helps technical interviewees practice LeetCode style questions with another person over the Internet. It is a ground-up rewrite of Peer Prep.

**My Role:** I'm the sole developer for this project, in charge of UI/UX design and implementation, backend system architecture and engineering, database management, DevOps etc.

**Why?:** I didn't have much experience building a full stack application, so this was a way for me to learn up React, microservice routing, Kubernetes, and deploying apps to the Internet. Plus since everyone is hiring Go engineers now...

**Status:** In progress

**Lessons Learnt:**

1. In software engineering, perfect isn't good enough.

**Technologies Used:**

- React.js
- Node.js
- Spring Boot
- Go
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Docker

## [Static Program Analyzer](https://github.com/huizhuansam/CS3203-SPA)

**Description:** Coursework for [CS3203: Software Engineering Project](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS3203/software-engineering-project). In this project, a team of 6 software engineers are tasked to write a static analyzer for a fictional programming language called [SIMPLE](https://nus-cs3203.github.io/course-website/contents/basic-spa-requirements/simple-programming.html).

**My Role:** I co-designed and developed the Source Processor library, and took the initiative to manage the build toolchain with CMake. To improve developer experience and code quality, I:

- Configured clang-format to enforce a consistent code style.
- Tuned compiler settings for Clang on macOS and MSVC on Windows to maximize optimization and enable strict compile-time checks to catch potential bugs early.
- Set up GitHub Actions workflows to automatically validate code quality before release.

As the project leader, I guided the team to deliver features on time, established effective development workflows, and led SCRUM rituals, including biweekly sprint planning and twice-weekly standups.

**Status:** Completed and archived

**Lessons Learnt:**

1. For projects of this size and scope, SCRUM felt like a waste of time and energy. I’m not saying it’s unimportant—it probably works better when the requirements are vague, like in real-world software engineering. But in our case, most of the biweekly sprints were spent managing GitHub Issues (which tracked contributions for grading) and writing the project report—tasks that could have easily been done asynchronously.
2. (Not) C++. I now understand how OOP works in C++, along with smart, dumb, silly, and zany pointers (yes, all of them), plus the whole ordeal with file headers. However, this project just didn’t need most of the language's powerful features—and honestly, it felt like overkill given how cumbersome C++ can be.
3. The study of programming languages is very interesting. I wished I had another semester in school to learn more about how compilers work, because Clang is basically black magic to me.
4. Team synergy > individual skill.

**Technologies Used:**

- C++17
- CMake
- Catch2
- GitHub Actions
